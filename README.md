# leaflet-challenge
In this assignment, I pull information on the earthquakes from the last seven days from United States Geological Survey and store it in a geoJSON file.
Using Leaflet and d3.js, I then plot all earthquakes listed. The size of each marker corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake while the color corresponds to its depth. A legend provides the user information regarding depth bins. Finally, a tooltip provides further information about any earthquake by clicking on the marker.
