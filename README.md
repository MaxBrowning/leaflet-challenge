# leaflet-challenge
In this assignment, I pull information on the earthquakes from the last seven days from United States Geological Survey and store it in a geoJSON file.
Using Leaflet and d3.js, I then plot all earthquakes listed. The size of each marker corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake while the color corresponds to its depth. A legend provides the user information regarding depth bins. Finally, a tooltip provides further information about any earthquake by clicking on the marker.

While starter code was provided for this assignment, all three files (logic.js, style.css, and index.html) required edits during the assignment to complete my solve method.
